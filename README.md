# What is this?
Atlas is a really good obfuscator base.

# Disclaimer
This project has not be made by me, but by someone named xSilent007.
The reason of this repositery is that his github (the xSilent007 one) has been deleted, and that I found a pity to lose such a project.
All credits goes therefore to xSilent007, as well as to the fantastic dnlib library (https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib) and to the incredible Rivers library (https://github.com/Washi1337/Rivers).
